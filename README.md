#	Dedcated web application for the offline mobile app

For the purpose of the offline mobile app a separate web application has been developed which is not a Sakai tool. This separate application allows the administrator to upload materials that can be downloaded from the offline mobile app for offline use. The following instructions are intended for the Administrator of the offline mobile app web component.
In order to access all the features (Upload, Update and Delete) we will need to log in.


In any case the users will be allowed to upload the offline material for a new language. The online material must be provided in a zip file format. The zipped folder will contain the levels, the courses and the units. 


After uploading the new language the contents are appearing in the browser:

1.	Display name / logout
2.	Display language name 
3.	Download, Delete and Update actions 
4.	Upload action
5.	Information about language #Units: number of units, Size: total size(MB) and Last Update.
6.	Information about pdf file. Skills: [Grammar Functions (G), Vocabulary (V), Reading Writing (R) and Listening Speaking (L)].

The lessons are unizipped in the server and are kept in a specific lesson folder, which resides in the user_directory /ComalatFolder/comalat Languages.Contents are extracted from a word file that should be provided in each subdirectory containing the units (i.e. the lessons).
